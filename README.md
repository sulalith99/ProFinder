# ProFinder

* ProFinder.py is a Python script that will find whether a specific program/software is in process or not and will send an email to the user once the process is completed.

* this is a combination of pMail.py and processFinder.py scripts.

* similar to the pMail.py script, it will only require the email address and the password of the account as the user inputs (the email account used in this script needs to be enabled with a less secure app option).
